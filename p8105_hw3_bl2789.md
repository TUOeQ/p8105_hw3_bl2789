# Problem 1

## a

  - The instacart data set should contain 1384617 observations and 15
    variables. and the type of varibles are listed below

<!-- end list -->

``` r

str(instacart)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    1384617 obs. of  15 variables:

  - There are **134** aisles and the **fresh vegetables** are the most
    items ordered from.

## b

``` r

  - For the products ordered more than 10,000 times,fresh vegetables and
    fruits are the most popular in the instacart.

    ## 9 dog food care             Small Dog Biscuits                           26

  - The top 3 best sells among packaged vegetables fruits are all
    organic foods, including Spinach, Raspberries, blueberries.
  - The top 3 baking ingredients is Light Brown Bugar,Pure Baking Soda
    and Cane Sugar.
  - The top 3 dog fod is Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog
    Treats,Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe and Small Dog Biscuits.

  - People are most likely to buy Pink lady apple arould 13:00 and
    Coffee Ice cream at 14:00 in each day of the week, and also the 0
    stands for Sunday, 1 for Monday,2 for Tuesday and etc. still 6 to

## Data cleaning

my_levels = c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")
response_adj = factor(pull(brfss_smart,response),levels = my_levels)
                  
brfss = brfss_smart%>%
        mutate(response_adj)%>%
        select(response_adj,everything(),-response)%>%
        arrange(response_adj)
```

## a

``` r
observed_2002 = brfss%>%
           filter(year == 2002)%>%
           group_by(location_abbr)%>%
           summarize(count=n())%>%
           filter(count/5>=7)%>%
           mutate(year = 2002)
  
observed_2010 = brfss%>%
           filter(year == 2010)%>%
           group_by(location_abbr)%>%
           summarize(count=n())%>%
           filter(count/5>=7)%>%
           mutate(year = 2010)
```

  - In 2002,The states *CT, FL, MA, NC, NJ, PA* were observed at 7 or
    more locations. And in year 2010, *CA, CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ,
    NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA* were observed at 7 or more locations.

## b

``` r
subset = brfss%>%
         filter(response_adj == "Excellent")%>%
         select(year,location_abbr,data_value)%>%
         group_by(year,location_abbr)%>%
         mutate(average = mean(data_value))%>%
         drop_na()%>%
         select(-data_value)%>%
         distinct() 

ggplot(subset,aes(x=year,y=average,col=location_abbr))+ 
  geom_line(aes(group = location_abbr))+
  labs(
    title = "Average across years for each state",
    x = "year",
    y = "data average",
    caption = "Overall Health") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_bl2789_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Since there are 51 states here the color is a little hard for me to
    distinguish from each other. The trend shows that overall health in
    Execent has been decreased across states. And at year 2005, we can
    observe a extreme decrease.

         aes(x=response_adj, y = data_value,color = location_desc,group=location_desc))+

```

![](p8105_hw3_bl2789_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

  - The graph shows that people claim to be *Very good* or *good* are
    actully perform better than excellent in both year 2006 and 2010,
    and actually they are getting better in more recent year in the New
    York area, as the upper limit increases.

  - Are any trends apparent?

days.
